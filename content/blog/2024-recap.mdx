2024 didn’t go as planned. But you know what? **I’m glad it didn’t**. This year has been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride. A tale of two halves, as I like to call it.

The first half of the year? Bland. Everything felt slow and uninspiring. I was stuck in a rut, trying to make sense of what I wanted to do and where I wanted to be. The days blurred into one another, and nothing stood out. Honestly, it felt like the universe hit pause on everything exciting.

Then came the second half, and everything changed. The day I started my M. Des in Interaction Design, it felt like someone flipped a switch. I was finally doing something I genuinely loved. Design has always been my thing, but pursuing it full-time felt like stepping into a whole new adventure.

I met some amazing people along the way—kind, talented, and inspiring individuals who made this journey special. For someone like me, an introvert who finds large groups overwhelming, this was a big deal. I pushed myself to have meaningful conversations, step out of my comfort zone, and embrace new experiences. And guess what? It was worth it.

Growth came in many forms this year. I learned to trust the process, even when it felt uncertain. I realized the importance of small steps, even when the bigger picture wasn’t clear. I discovered joy in doing what I truly love.

To everyone who made this year special, you know who you are. Thank you. Your kindness, support, and little moments of encouragement meant the world to me.

As I look back, I’m grateful for both the good and the bad. The good brought me happiness, and the bad taught me lessons I needed to learn.

And oh, I managed to achieve 75% of my resolutions! Not perfect, but progress and I’ll take that.

Here’s to 2025, a year of more growth, more happiness, and more memories to cherish. If 2024 taught me anything, it’s that plans may change, but there’s beauty in embracing the unexpected. Cheers to whatever comes next!
