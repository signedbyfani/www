It’s been a while since I last wrote here. The last post was on 31st December 2024. I’ve been meaning to write something for months, but things just kept piling up. Today, I finally sat down to share how the year has been going. Too many things to share. 

## Semester 2 was hectic but rewarding

The second semester of my M.Des course was really hectic. It felt like I was constantly chasing deadlines. But looking back, it turned out to be **one of the most productive phases of my life.** I learned a lot and grew as a designer in many ways. I worked on many projects that I’m really proud of.

### The first one focused on accessibility - We redesigned a crutch tip to improve grip and durability.

### Worked on a project to enhance the desirability of Jaipur City Buses
This project made me think more deeply about behavioural design, **how space and environment can influence how people behave**. We explored ways to make public transport feel more welcoming, safe, and desirable, especially for people who don’t usually consider buses their first choice. 
> Working on the case study. Will update here once it's published.

## Earning through Framer & Freelance Gigs 
Outside of course work, I also started earning through Framer. I created a few templates and they actually started selling.

[Check out my Framer Templates](https://fani.lemonsqueezy.com/)


### MyTags App

One of the major projects I took on was for the MyTags app. I redesigned their mobile app to make it market-ready. The final build is currently under production, and they’re about to launch soon. I’ll be sharing a full case study of this project very soon.

### Framer Websites for clients

Along with that, I also worked on a few more Framer projects for different clients. It’s been exciting to collaborate with people and bring their ideas to life.

## Jaipur Design Week 

Another highlight from this year was designing the official website for Jaipur Design Week.

### Data Viz Workshop by Gurman Bhatia
I also attended Data Visualisation workshop by Gurman Bhatia during the JDW. Learned a lot from her approach and perspective, especially how **storytelling can be tightly woven into data and design.**

## Campus Revamp Work

Back on campus, [Tanishqka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanishqka/) and I got involved in a few revamp projects. We worked on redesigning the gym and also gave concept ideas for the Institute of Design’s space revamp. These projects helped me step into more multi-disciplinary thinking. It felt good to be part of shaping the spaces around us and shaping people’s behaviour.

## Life Lately -

On the personal side, I’ve lost a few kilos recently. But I’ve also **developed a strong chai habit.** Mentally, this year has been tough. There were many moments when I felt stretched thin. **I’m grateful for the quiet and steady support that stayed constant through all of it when things got overwhelming.** I’ve also learned a lot about myself during this time. Managing different projects, juggling deadlines, and trying to stay grounded through it all has helped me build confidence and patience.

## Some more updates -

My MacBook has hit more than 200 battery cycles after almost an year, and the battery health is still holding at 97%. I’ve really been pushing it this semester. Let’s see how long it keeps up.

- A small dream came true when I got the **MX Master 3S** mouse from a friend. It’s been one of those tools I’ve always wanted, and using it daily still feels exciting.
- I also **gifted my mom a pair of earbuds** - a tiny thing, but it felt nice to give back in small ways.
- Lately, I’ve started taking **skincare more seriously.** It’s something I used to overlook, but thanks to peer pressure and self realization, I started prioritizing it.

One more thing I really enjoyed working on - I designed a zine on **కోడి పందాలు** (Rooster Fights). It was a representation of a local tradition of my state.

## That’s All for Now

That’s a small update on everything that’s been happening in 2025. It feels nice to finally put it all down. I’ll try not to take this long before writing again.
