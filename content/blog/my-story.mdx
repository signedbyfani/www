## Alright people, Let’s start from the very beginning

Hi, I’m Fanindra — full name **Rudra Sai Pavan Fanindra Maharana**. Depending on where you’re from in India, my name might either seem incredibly long or quite normal. I completed my primary schooling near my home and went to a boarding school for secondary schooling. Despite not being the most studious, I managed to score well throughout my schooling.

## The Crossroads

I couldn’t clear my JEE Mains, but I did get a good rank in Paper 2 (B. Arch), which opened a potential path in architecture for me. I also scored well in AMECET (Aircraft Maintenance Engineering). I found myself at a crossroads, torn between my mind, which leaned towards Computer Science, and my heart, which was drawn to architecture. Ultimately, I chose to follow my mind.

## Computer Science and The Beginning of My Design Journey

I started my B. Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at VIT, Bhopal. Thanks to COVID, we had our classes taken online for almost two years. Once we returned to campus, I began to question my choices. DSA and problem-solving weren’t my strengths; I only enjoyed front-end development and completed a few projects in that area.

During this time, I discovered UX Design and everything changed. The more I learned about UX design, the more I fell in love with it. I decided to switch entirely to design.

## Initial struggles

I began my journey with the Google UX Design Certification on **Coursera**. However, I quickly realized this alone wasn’t enough to make me a good designer. So, I turned to YouTube, where several channels played a significant role in my learning (not in any particular order):

## Projects and Upskilling

I worked on a few personal projects and gradually gained confidence in my skills. I started applying for internships and landed a UI/UX Design Intern position at Pulpit Mobility. After the internship, I sought more opportunities, but despite my efforts, I struggled to find a good fit. Whether it was the market situation or my skills, I couldn’t say. I even considered joining the 10k Designers cohort for upskilling but decided against it.

## Pursuing M. Des

Building upon my parents’ advice, I decided to pursue a Master’s degree in Design. I researched colleges offering M. Des in Interaction Design, UX Design, or HCI. Studying abroad was never an option, so I focused on collges in India. I learned about CEED, an entrance exam for IITs and other design colleges, but my under-par drawing and sketching skills meant I didn’t score well.

I applied for several colleges, including IDC IIT Bombay, IIT Hyderabad, IIT Delhi, DTU, IIT Jodhpur, JKLU, and WUD. I was shortlisted for interviews at JKLU, WUD, and IIT Jodhpur and received acceptance letters from JKLU and WUD. Based on my interview experiences, I preferred JKLU.

I started my **M. Des in Interaction Design at JKLU, Jaipur** in July 2024. I’m excited to see where this journey takes me next. Stay tuned for more.
