We live in a world full of choices. From the moment we wake up, we’re deciding—what to wear, what to eat, what to focus on. Some decisions are small, like what to wear for tomorrow. Others are big, like choosing a career path. But how often do we stop and ask ourselves: Does it matter?

This simple question can help us figure out what’s important. It can guide us to spend our time and energy on things that truly matter.

## Ask Yourself Before Making a Choice

Before you make a choice, take a moment to ask yourself: Does it matter? Is it important to me? Will it make a difference in my life?

Think about arguments, for example. How often have you argued about something small to prove you’re right? Was it worth your time and energy or the relationship you spoiled? Probably not.

On the other hand, this question also helps with positive choices. Imagine you’re thinking of starting a new hobby. Asking Does it matter? can help you decide if it will bring you joy or help you grow, or if it’s just a distraction.

## Is It Worth Your Time?

Time is precious. Every time you say yes to one thing, you’re saying no to something else. Asking Does it matter? helps you decide what’s worth your time.

For example, we often spend hours doing things that don’t matter—scrolling through social media, worrying about small problems, or trying to please everyone. Meanwhile, the things that truly matter—like spending time with loved ones, learning something new, or taking care of ourselves—get pushed aside.

When you ask this question often, you’ll start spending your time on things that truly make your life better.

## Small Choices Matter Too

Not all choices are big, but even small ones can add up. Deciding to take a walk instead of scrolling on your phone, smiling at someone instead of staying silent—these small actions can lead to big changes over time.

When you ask Does it matter?, even small choices can become meaningful.

## Letting Go

This question isn’t just about saying yes to the right things. It’s also about saying no to the wrong ones. Sometimes, we need to let go of habits, relationships, or tasks that don’t help us anymore.

Letting go isn’t easy, but it makes space for better things. It’s freeing and allows us to focus on what truly matters.

## Live with Purpose

Life is busy and full of distractions. But we don’t have to go through it without thinking. By asking Does it matter?, we can make better choices, focus on what’s important, and live a more meaningful life.

So next time you’re about to make a decision, pause and ask yourself: Does it matter? You might find the answer surprising—and helpful.
