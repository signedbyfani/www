## Something about me

In case you don’t know it already, I’m an extreme introvert and find crowds overwhelming, feel uneasy and sometimes even breathless when there are more than eight people around. Socializing isn’t easy for me — honestly, I struggle with it altogether. However, I do enjoy conversations with new people, as long as it’s one-on-one or in a small group of no more than three. Once I get comfortable with someone, I can talk endlessly.

I love engaging with strangers to understand their perspectives on life and other topics. For example, when I’m in a cab, I often chat with the driver about local attractions, food, their views on life, beliefs, and more. It’s fascinating to see how the same world is experienced differently by each person. I find it enriching to view the world through other people’s eyes.

One advantage to being an introvert is that people tend to listen to me carefully when I do speak, as they know my words are rare and considered.

**When asked if I ever wish to socialize more, my answer is simple: “Nah. I’m good.” So I feel there are no cons to being an introvert.**

## Recharging Social Battery

My social battery is very limited, much like an iPhone mini’s battery. Whenever I feel like I’ve depleted it, I usually run away (like literally) from crowds and try to be alone. I self-introspect during that time. I think about my future, career, things I want to do or improve something related to academics, personal stuff, etc. Recently, though, I’ve started sharing these recharging moments with someone, someone I can trust completely, someone I know won’t judge me at all. I’m really grateful to have found that person in my life. While I do like being alone, it’s comforting to have someone I can open up to.

One suggestion I would give to anyone who deals with limited social battery issues is just to get some space. It’s not rude to walk away from crowds. At the end of the day, your mental health matters. Try to be alone (not lonely, but alone). Think about yourself, and your future, and manifest things (if you believe in them). Have a chat with someone whom you trust. Get things off your chest. I strongly suggest being away from your phones during this time, stop scrolling reels and shorts. They do more bad than good. Just be away from your phones even though it’s hard… just try it. Be a better person.

## Embracing solitude

There is a line by Tyrion Lannister from Game of Thrones - “Never forget what you are. Because the rest of the world will not. Wear it like an armour and it can never be used to hurt you”. I remind myself of this line every time. Embrace your imperfections so that no one can hurt you with them. Be proud of what you are. When someone says you don’t speak a lot, tell them you are happy being the silent person.

## Read what my friends have to say about me

- **Sibaani -** You are not actually an introvert. You are an ambivert. You just need more time than others to break your ice. Once you are through this, you are a warm person. Stay this way forever. Gentlemen of your kind are hard to find these days.
- **Gokul -** Nice guy!
- **Shubham -** You are a good guy even on the surface level and You try to be helpful in general and be even more useful to some people because you want to make more friends.
- **Shruti -** The best thing about you is you help everyone without expecting anything in return. There are very few people like this and you are one of them.
- **Tanishqka -** At first glance, I thought you were rude since you didn’t respond when I first tried to talk to you. But as I got to know the **real** you, I realized that you are one of the most precious gems to have around. With you I feel like I can talk, cry, laugh, dance, sing and just be myself without any fear of judgment. So yeah, I’m really looking forward to making some amazing memories with you, mate.

## Parting thoughts

I gained a deeper understanding of myself after hearing my friends’ perspectives. I value deep personal connections and take my time to form them, but once I do, I’m fully committed and will go to great lengths for the people I bond with. Being an introvert isn’t something that happened to me by chance; it’s a choice I’ve made. I’ve always wanted to be the calm presence in a group of energetic people, the one who can bring a sense of peace and stability to others. I like being an introvert and will always stay this way.
