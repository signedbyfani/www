## Why am I writing this?

As mentioned in my previous blog, I enjoy being in solitude. But a question might arise—why do we need some me time? What do we get from being alone? This isn’t just a personal preference but something that holds deeper meaning for a lot of people. In our hyperconnected world, the idea of isolating ourselves from others might sound counterintuitive. However, there are immense benefits in doing so—both mentally and emotionally.

Someone asked me, “Why do you prefer to be alone most of the time?” Only then did I reflect on it and search for answers within myself. Why do I like being alone? What do I feel when I’m in isolation? What do I think about? It’s important to note the difference between being alone and being lonely. There’s a huge distinction between the two. Loneliness is often accompanied by feelings of sadness, exclusion, or disconnection while being alone is a choice—a moment of peace, reflection, and self-rejuvenation. For me, isolation has become a sanctuary, a space where I can hear myself think and reconnect with my inner world.

When I’m alone, I usually think about my future. I think about the things I want to accomplish, what steps I need to take to get there, and how I can become a better version of myself. Isolation creates room for these thoughts—there will be no distractions and no external noise to block out my inner voice.

I believe that carving out some alone time might just be one of the best things you can do for your mental well-being

## Self-Reflection and Personal Growth

When we’re constantly surrounded by others, it’s easy to lose track of our thoughts and desires. In solitude, we can tap into the core of our inner self. It provides an opportunity to reflect on who we are, what we want, and what we’ve experienced. This is where true personal growth happens.

Being alone allows me to ask myself difficult questions: What are my weaknesses? What are my strengths? How can I improve? These moments of introspection are crucial because they lead to self-awareness. I can identify patterns, address personal shortcomings, and appreciate the progress I’ve made in different areas of life.

For me, without isolation, it’s almost impossible to achieve this level of clarity. Self-growth demands space—physically and mentally—to evaluate your journey. You need time to process your thoughts, evaluate your decisions, and understand what matters.

## Creativity and Focus

Some of the most creative ideas come when we are alone. This is because our minds are not preoccupied with the noise of everyday life—there’s room for imagination to take flight. When I work on design projects or personal ventures, isolation provides the uninterrupted focus I need to get into a creative flow.

When surrounded by others or constantly engaged with technology, we often feel like we’re multitasking, splitting our focus in multiple directions. But true creativity demands sustained attention and deep thinking. Solitude helps to shut out the world, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in our work or ideas. Without distractions, the mind can wander freely, making space for novel ideas to emerge.

## Mental Rejuvenation

In our fast-paced world, being constantly engaged—whether in social situations or digital spaces—can be mentally exhausting. Isolation acts as a recharge station for the mind. By stepping away from social obligations, I find time to reset, relax, and restore my energy levels. Solitude allows me to declutter my mind, especially after long periods of interaction or work. It’s a mental breather that rejuvenates me, helping me regain clarity and emotional balance.

This process of mental rejuvenation is vital for maintaining mental health. Without it, stress and burnout can quickly take over. Even a brief moment of quiet solitude can have a profound impact on our emotional well-being.

## Developing new hobbies

My hobby is to develop new hobbies. I tried out various things and developed interests in many of them. I can be good company if you want to talk about anything ranging from cricket, politics, keyboards, history, maps, technology and also psychology. When we’re alone, we often return to activities that bring us joy—whether it’s reading a book, practising photography, exploring design, or simply walking in nature. These are things we do purely for ourselves, without any external validation or pressure.

Isolation offers us the chance to reconnect with hobbies we may have sidelined due to life’s demands. It’s a time when we can focus on activities that nourish our souls. I often find myself diving deep into photography, capturing moments that resonate with me or experimenting with design concepts that interest me. These hobbies not only bring me joy but also help me feel centred and fulfilled.

## Embracing Solitude

In a world that never stops moving, taking time for isolation might seem indulgent, but it’s necessary. Solitude isn’t about escaping from the world—it’s about retreating into yourself, and finding the balance you need to re-enter the world with renewed energy, focus, and purpose.

So, next time you feel overwhelmed or disconnected from yourself, try embracing solitude. Spend time in quiet reflection. Listen to your thoughts. Find peace in being alone, and in doing so, you may find that it’s one of the most enriching experiences life has to offer.
