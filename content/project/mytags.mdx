## Context

MyTags is a utility-focused mobile app that helps users **tag and track personal items using QR codes.** When a tagged item is lost and found, the finder can scan the tag to view a custom message and contact the owner.

[App Store Link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mytags-io/id6446153117?platform=iphone)  //  [mytags.io](https://mytags.io/)

The client **had a working MVP with limited features** and a minimal interface. As they planned to open the product to the public, **they needed a polished and user-friendly mobile experience** that could scale and build user trust.

This is where I came in - **to elevate the design, rethink the flow, and bring clarity to both sides of the experience**: the tag owner and the person who scans a found item.

## Client's brief - 

> It (The current **MVP**) was built with a **'just make it work'** approach. I’m now looking to redesign the app with **a clean and intuitive user interface** that better represents the idea and improves the user experience.

## Looking from a user's perceptive 
After speaking with the client and understanding the core functionality of the app, I began using it myself. The client provided sample QR tags, which I attached to personal items like my backpack and keys to simulate real usage.

Over the course of three days, I explored the app hands-on and identified several key UX issue and usability gaps.

To further validate these insights, I invited friends and family members ranging in age from 15 to 55 to try the app. This group included both tech-savvy users and those who typically find mobile apps challenging, giving me a broader perspective on accessibility and usability.


## Design Goals 
**How might we redesign the MyTags mobile app to feel more polished, intuitive, and scalable**

### The app should:
- Make it easy for users to manage their tags and assets
- Nudge users to order and link more tags
- Provide a seamless experience for finders scanning a tag
- Maintain a minimal, clean visual design


## Establishing a design direction

To align with the client’s vision, I created a quick moodboard with inspiration from various sources. Design directions include - minimal light, minimal dark & minimal colorful.

We discussed each option and eventually locked in **a light-themed minimal aesthetic**, which matched their brand sensibility and product purpose. I created quick mockup explorations based on this theme exploring different colors. We eventually **finalized on black accents and white background** - similar to Uber

## Low-to-Mid Fidelity Design
**Skipping wireframes, I directly jumped into mid-fidelity** mockups to speed up the ideation process. The goal was to establish the core flow of the application, which includes:

- A new **dashboard-style homepage** showing
  - Tags and Assets
  - Recent Activity
  - Buttons to add tags, assets or to scan a tag
- Clear visibility of the no. of tags a user owns and no. of untagged assets
- A **nudge mechanism** that alerts users when tags are not linked to items, **encouraging them** to take action or **order more tags**

## Design System
I created the design system for both the MyTags app and brand to ensure a consistent visual style and user experience across the app, website, and other brand touchpoints.

## Client Feedback & Expansion
After reviewing the design system and mid-fidelity direction, **the client responded positively.** They appreciated both the structure and visual language of the app. During our discussions, **they highlighted a few additional screens and edge cases that needed coverage.**

### I then expanded the scope to design the entire app interface, covering:
- All key flows and features
- Supporting screens and states
- Edge-case interactions (e.g., no tags linked, blank states, etc.)

### Designing for the Finder’s Experience:
In parallel to refining the experience for tag owners, I also **designed a streamlined flow for finders.** When someone scans a QR-tagged item, they are met with a friendly interface that:
- Clearly indicates the tag’s ownership
- Provides an effortless call-to-action to contact the owner
- **Uses a tone that promotes trust and encourages cooperation**

## Final Designs & Prototyping
Once the screens were complete, I created a fully interactive prototype showcasing transitions, animations, and microinteractions to communicate the app’s feel more accurately.

> The client reviewed the final version and approved the designs without any revisions, reinforcing their confidence in my design decisions and execution.


## Outcome & Current Status
The redesigned MyTags app now offers a clear, robust structure that enhances the user experience for both tag owners and finders. The final design is clean, intentionally crafted, and ready to scale with its public launch.
