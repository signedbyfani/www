## Overview

UberPool is great for efficiency but has a major drawback—riders must commit to carpooling before booking, which might not always align with their preferences.

This case study presents a new feature: **Dynamic Carpooling**—a flexible way for users to choose carpooling after their ride has started. This enhances ride efficiency while keeping user preferences in mind.

## The Problem

Despite UberPool's existence, many users hesitate to opt in beforehand because:

- They worry about potential delays due to additional pickups
- They want a guaranteed ride first, and later decide if sharing is okay
- Fixed carpool pricing upfront might not always be the best deal

A more dynamic carpooling option allows flexibility, letting riders decide in real time
