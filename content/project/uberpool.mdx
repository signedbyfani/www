## Overview

Ride-sharing seems like the perfect solution for Indian cities - it saves money, reduces traffic, and promotes sustainability. But in reality, it hasn’t taken off.

**UberPool didn’t quite work in India.** Despite its promise, users hesitated to opt in. Meanwhile, **alternatives like BlaBlaCar suffer from lack of verification** and safety, which makes people wary of using them, especially solo riders.

> This case study introduces a more context-aware solution - **Dynamic Carpooling.** A flexible feature where riders **can start their trip solo and then decide to share mid-ride,** all within Uber’s trusted and verified ecosystem.

## The Real Problem

UberPool in India failed to scale up for a few key reasons:

- Riders **don’t want to commit** to a shared ride before knowing who else is in the car
- There’s a **fear of delays** due to detours and pickups
- Upfront pricing for pooled rides **didn’t always feel like a good deal**
- **Trust** is a major issue - users don’t want to share space with unverified strangers

Apps like **BlaBlaCar** aimed to solve the same problem but **lacked the verification, safety checks, and platform trust** needed to build confidence, especially in urban solo travel.


## A Better Way: Dynamic Carpooling within Uber

> **What if Uber gave riders more control and confidence?**

Dynamic Carpooling gives riders the **option to toggle “Open to Carpool”** at the time of booking, but the ride starts as a private trip. If a match is found during the ride with another verified rider on a similar route, Uber notifies the user and lets them choose whether to accept.

The best part? Uber already has what most carpooling apps don’t, **a strong verification system,** real-time trip tracking, and a **reputation for safety.**

## Why This Works

- **Built on Trust** - Uber already has verified users, driver ratings, and live tracking unlike most carpooling apps
- **Gives Control** - Riders start solo and choose to share only when they’re comfortable and satisfied with the adjusted fare
- **Saves Money** - The system incentivizes sharing with live discounted fares
- **Boosts Sustainability** - Every shared ride reduces empty seats and traffic load

## The Takeaway
**India doesn’t need more ride-sharing apps.** It needs smarter ways to share. With Dynamic Carpooling, Uber can bridge the trust gap that killed UberPool and outdo players like BlaBlaCar by **turning shared mobility into a choice, not a compromise.**
