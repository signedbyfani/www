## Background and Context

In bustling urban environments, **employees frequently face inefficient and disorganized parking systems.** With limited space, unclear navigation, and no visibility into availability, the process of **finding a spot can waste valuable time and energy** before the workday even begins. This project focuses on redesigning that experience into something seamless and intuitive.

**Objective:** Design a mobile app that helps employees locate, reserve, and access parking spots in office campuses quickly and confidently.

## Understanding the problem

To understand user needs, I conducted primary research with employees across different offices. This led to the development of two key user personas:

<Image

  alt="User Persona 2"
  width={2580}
  height={1691}

  size="base"
/>

### Key Insights from Research

From these personas and interviews, three primary pain points emerged:
- **Spot Unavailability:** Employees often arrive to find no available spots, especially during peak hours.
- **Unauthorized Parking:** Visitors or unregistered vehicles frequently occupy reserved spaces.
- **Noise Pollution:** Frequent use of car alarms creates distraction and a noisy environment near office areas.


## Ideation
### These insights informed the following project goals:

- Provide real-time visibility into available parking spots
- Allow employees to reserve a spot before arrival
- Enable digital entry and spot verification to prevent misuse

### User Flow
To support these goals, I created structured user flows outlining the two core journeys - onboarding and the main parking flow

  alt="User Flow - Main"
  width={2580}
  height={1691}
  caption="User Flow - Main"
  contained
  size="lg"
/>

### Digital Wireframes
Using the flows as a guide, I began sketching low-fidelity wireframes to visualize the key touchpoints like onboarding, map view, reservation process, and digital pass screens

### Design System
To ensure consistency across the app, I developed a clean, modern design system

## Final Screens

The final interface is designed to be intuitive, efficient, and accessible, available in both light and dark modes.

## Conclusion 
Parked successfully addresses key employee frustrations by offering real-time visibility, smoother navigation, and secure access. The design process was driven by real user observations, validated through iterations, and grounded in everyday workplace behavior.

### Future Enhancements
- Integrate payment for reserved spots
- Enable carpool coordination
- Extend availability tracking to public parking zones

This project demonstrates how focused UX research and thoughtful design can bring clarity to a chaotic everyday experience.
