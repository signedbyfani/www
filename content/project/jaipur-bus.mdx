## Context & Background

Jaipur, a growing metropolitan hub, sees increasing dependence on private modes of transportation like autos, cabs, and private vehicles. Despite a large fleet of city buses operated by JCTSL (Jaipur City Transport Services Ltd.), the perception of these services is extremely poor among students, working professionals, and the general middle class.

I'm still working on the detailed case study - expect it within this week. Stay tuned!

{/* ### 🔍 Design Brief

**Goal:** Improve the _desirability_ of Jaipur city buses among young adults and professionals.

**Stakeholder:** JCTSL  
**Target Users:** Students, essential workers, and employees  
**Core Problem:** Negative perception and outdated systems reduce usage and trust.

## 🧭 Design Process

---

### 1. 🧠 Secondary Research

We began with a broad analysis of public transport systems in India, focusing on intra-city road-based systems like buses, autos, and cabs.

#### Key Insight:
> While cabs and autos offer convenience, buses are seen as confusing, disorganized, and not meant for "people like us."

---

### 2. 🕵️‍♀️ User Research

We interviewed:
- **Students** — who rarely use buses and feel unsafe
- **Essential workers** — who rely on buses but face mistreatment
- **Employees** — who view buses as chaotic and avoid them

> "I don't know if the bus will come or if I'm at the right stop."  
> → Confidence in the system is eroded by uncertainty.

---

### 3. 🚌 Ethnographic Observation

Our team took multiple city buses in Jaipur and recorded observations.

#### Challenges We Saw:
- Unclear or broken-down bus stops
- Confusing bus numbering
- No guidance during boarding
- Untrained or multitasking staff
- Dirty and unsafe-feeling environments

> "Not really a Shubh Yatra." — sarcastic comment from a passenger, highlighting the disconnect between branding and experience.

---

### 4. 🗣 Stakeholder Interviews

We interviewed JCTSL field officers, conductors, and IT managers.

#### Insights:
- Staff assumed buses were "not for iPhone users"
- Only 5% of users book tickets online
- No current plans to improve shelters
- Digital payment is still unsupported

### 5. 🧩 Synthesis

| Problem                  | Evidence                        | Impact                         |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Perceived lack of safety | Students avoid buses entirely   | No first-hand trial             |
| No bus stop clarity      | Observed & reported by users    | Reduces confidence              |
| Disjointed experience    | Unclear boarding/payment        | Frustrates new users            |
| Outdated systems         | No real-time or UPI             | Excludes digital-first citizens |
| Internal biases          | Staff assumptions about class   | Alienates a potential user base |

### 6. ❓ How Might We?

- **HMW improve waiting and boarding cues?**  
- **HMW help JCTSL understand users better?**  
- **HMW reposition buses as inclusive for all classes?**  
- **HMW share live info with passengers?**  
- **HMW modernize ticketing systems?**

---

### 7. 💡 Ideation

#### A. 🛑 Density-Based Bus Stop Design

- **High-density**: Shelters + display boards + branding  
- **Mid-density**: Signage + QR for live tracking  
- **Low-density**: Visual markers + minimal infrastructure  

#### B. 🔊 Audio Cues

- "Bus arriving" & "Bus leaving" tones  
- Alerts to prevent overcrowding  
- Improves accessibility for all passengers

#### C. 🎨 Visual Rebranding

- Bold, modern visuals  
- Clear, branded signage  
- Young and inclusive tone

---

### 8. 🧠 Reflections & Next Steps

Our research revealed that infrastructural neglect, social stigma, and outdated systems all contribute to low desirability.

#### Next Steps:
- Prototype bus stop types
- Pilot audio cues at key stops
- Modernize JCTSL's digital ticketing system
- Conduct an inclusive branding campaign

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. Trust in public transport can't be built through vehicles alone—**design for experience matters.**
2. Small shifts in **visual and audio communication** can change perception drastically.
3. JCTSL needs a mindset shift—**not just a fleet upgrade.**
